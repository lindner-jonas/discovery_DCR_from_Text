The process starts when the storage facility used by Puori sends a product sample to Ellipse. Ellipse then notifies Puori of the new sample. Before testing can begin, Puori then request a test of a sample through Ellipse. Ellipse must then test the product, as well as have additional testing done through Eurofarms. When all testing is done, results will be compiled into a report before sending the report to Puori for approval. This enables Puori to evaluate the results. If the results are different than expected, Puori may ask Ellipse for re-testing. If the results of the re-testing do not live up to Puoris standards, the batch will be discarded. If the results are sound Ellipse must send the results to Clean Label, who must then publish the results. Puori then checks whether all is in order and either approves of the publication, or compiles a list of possible errors. If errors are found, Clean Label must correct the errors before publishing the results again.
