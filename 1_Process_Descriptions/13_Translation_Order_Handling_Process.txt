Every time a translation order is received, an agent needs to check it. If the document is in a DOCX (Word) format, the agent “analyses” it in the ERP (this will automatically process the document and fill in information regarding document length, word count and repetition count). If the document is a PDF format, the agent either converts the document manually to DOCX through a third-party program or calls the client and requests a different format document. Once the document is analysed, the agent sets a quota for the order in the system. The agent choose a translator from the database and sends a request to them. The translator can either accept or decline the task. If accepted the agent receives a notification and sends the quota to the client. If the client accepts it, a notification is sent to the translator that work can begin, otherwise if the quota is declined the order is closed. If the translator declines the request, the agent looks for another translator. Once the translator is done with the translation, the translator uploads the translated document. The agent will then check the translated work to ensure that it looks up-to-standard. If deemed satisfactory the agent will close the case and the translated document together with an invoice is sent to the client.
